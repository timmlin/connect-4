## Connect 4 Game 

# Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using the Pygame library. Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a vertical grid. The objective of the game is to connect four discs of the same color in a line (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.
